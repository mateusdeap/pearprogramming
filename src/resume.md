## Summary
- Developed Rails and mobile Android apps for the state's moto vehicle department
- Developed an NPS feature for driver and passenger applications at Gaudium
- Upgraded many Rails applications from versions as old as 3.2 up to Rails 7
- Helped clients improve code quality, test coverage and performance through analysis and planned out refactors
- Improved internal tooling to reduce Rails upgrade complexity and uncertainty
- Made modest contributions to Ruby opensource projects I really cared about

## Work Experience
### Systems Analyst
#### Detran CE (Mar 2018 - Dec 2020)
- Implemented a Rails app to control access to department grounds, integrating with
an Android application in Java and thermal printers to allow department staff to control
what service a given visitor was going to perform and how long it took him to go through
the whole process
- Reformulated the department's Android field operations application, allowing field agents
to properly process drivers during their law enforcement efforts, implementing a better
UI and integrating with all the department's backend APIs written in Java with Spring Boot
- Developed a Rails app that allowed department staff to create customer satisfaction
questionnaires for the different services available to citizens
- Upgraded 4 of our Rails applications from Rails 3 and 4 up to Rails 6, the most recent
version at the time.
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines in Gitlab for these applications

### Android Developer
#### Gaudium Global (Dec 2020 - May 2021)
- Implemented the company's NPS feature from scratch, creating a PHP microservice that
integrated to their backend, and integrating that backend with the main mobile Android
app.
- Modified and created screens for the new delivery service application.

### Senior Software Engineer
#### OmbuLabs (May 2021 - Present)
- Upgraded very large applications from Rails as old as 3.2 up to Rails 7
- Led Rails upgrade projects, mentoring junior developers and guaranteeing
proper client communication as well as making the proper tradeoffs, delivering
a finished upgrade with quality code improvements
- Developed new features for [Points](https://github.com/fastruby/points), improving our workflow
when estimating tasks and assessing effort during upgrades
- Wrote an Elixir script to classify RSpec failures, reducing the amount of complexity
and uncertainty around the time estimates for fixing a client's broken test suite
after making their app run on their target next Rails version
- Improved code and client test suites as part of upgrade efforts, making them
more efficient and eliminating false positives in passing tests.
- Assessed code complexity and amount of tech debt for Bonsai clients, giving them
a clear picture on the improvements that could be made to the application, while
also gradually moving their application to a more up to date state concerning
their Rails version and their dependencies
- Contributed to open source projects I like with either code, documentation or
smaller maintenance tasks: [reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek), [ruby-lsp](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp),
[natalie](https://github.com/natalie-lang/natalie) and others
