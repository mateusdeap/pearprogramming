It's been a long time since I posted anything. The reason being, I really couldn't think
of anything worth sharing.

But I finally have something. I made a bitcoin RPC client in Ruby. Bitcoinr. 'r' for Ruby and
for pronouncing it "Bitcoiner".

Now, I do know there is already such a gem called [bitcoin-ruby](https://github.com/lian/bitcoin-ruby),
but it hasn't been updated in a while (5 years) and I wanted to make my own client.

Why? Well, I run my own node, I want to learn how to use the RPC interface and I program in Ruby.
It just seemed like the natural thing to do.

It is a very rudimentary piece of software, however. It has no pretentions of grandeur and I don't
even know when nor if I'll publish it as a gem. In the meantime, it can be cloned from its GitLab
repo [here](https://gitlab.com/mateuspereira/bitcoinr).

It is open to contributions, but without any promises of support or anything.
