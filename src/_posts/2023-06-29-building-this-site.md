### tl;dr
This is kind of where I started:
<img src="/images/building_this_site/before.png" />

And this is where I got:
<img src="/images/building_this_site/after.png" />

### motivation
So, basically, I've been taking notes of the things I do with my programming time in order to be more organized and to slowly build a knowledge base, if you will, that I could later reference and, of course, use it to make my CV look cool.

I've been beating around the bush for this project for the longest time. I tried out quite a few static site generators but I could never settle with one. Nor did I feel I had the content to share, so I ended up just spending hours picking themes and not writing much.

Well, now I've got the content, and here it is.

In the end, I picked the one generator that I heard a lot about but that didn't have nearly as many ready to go themes as I had seen with Jekyll or Hugo: Bridgetown.

### the experience
Well, II don't think there's much to be said. It's good. It does what I need it to do, it gives me a barebones, no css (or almost no css) and no JS website ready for me to write to.

And, apparently, that's what I needed, because this post is being written and I feel like finally I'm publishing things worth reading. Ate least worth reading to me by my own future self.

The main lesson I learned was:

>You don't need themes, you don't need plugins. You need a site and you should learn basic CSS. It'll do wonders for you. And if you don't know what to write about, take notes of what
>you do at work. Everyday we learn something new that's worth putting down to paper. Or bits, in our case.
